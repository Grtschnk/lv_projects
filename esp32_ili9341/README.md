To link LittlevGL (lvgl) and lv_examples with ESP-IDF you need to add a **component.mk** file to each directory. Next to the REAMDE file you find two example component.mk files
- lvgl_component.mk
- lv_example_component.mk

Remanme them to component.mk and copy to the lvgl and lv_examples directories.
